[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/5e1umwa6jpqi9skr/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/paulalves/torclient/branch/master)

Just a lightweight Tor client written in C# with .NET Core and lot of :coffee: as usual. Make HTTP calls through a proxy as Privoxy that will fowards the requests by the Tor Network.

## Sample 

```csharp 
var serviceUrl = "https://get.geojs.io/v1/ip/country/full/{0}";

using (var client = new TorClient(new TorOptions { Password = "<Your Password Here>" })) {
    await client.TorControl.RenewIpAddressAsync();

    var location = await client.Http.GetStringAsync(string.Format(
        serviceUrl,
        client.IpAddress));

    Console.WriteLine(location);
}
```
